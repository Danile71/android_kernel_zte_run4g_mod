/*
 * README.android describes in high-level the LLVM changes that we cannot push
 * upstream to the llvm.org repository:
 *  - Changes due to Android's build system.
 *  - Changes due to Android's toolchain.
 *  - Changes due to the limitations in Android-based consumer electronics.
 *
 * Some of them are to-dos. If and when they are done, there will no longer be
 * merge conflicts with upstream on those parts.
 *
 * The file contains useful hints when we try to resolve future 3-way merge
 * conflicts.
