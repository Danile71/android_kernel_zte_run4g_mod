[display_primary_memory_test basic]
	this ut uses memory session and primary session to display multiple layers. 
	If layer_num > primary_session_max_layers memory session will be used for cascade.
	Just use session_test -x to get help message:
        printf("usage: %s"\
            " [-w layer_width]"\
            " [-h layer_height]"\
            " [-l layer_num]"\
            " [-f frame_num]"\
            " [-p primary_session_layer_num]"\
            " [-m memory_session_layer_num]"\
            , argv[0]);\
