 * 2. Too many informations, and thet can be grouped by handle.

 * All kinds of memory use the same handle define.
 * According to their different purpose, they are redefined to specific name.

 * Shared memory
 *
 * A shared memory is normal memory, which can be seen by Normal world and Secure world.
 * It is used to create the comminicattion between two worlds.
 * Currently, zero-copy data transfer is supportted, for simple and efficient design.
 *
 * The shared memory lifetime:
 * 1. CA (Client Application at REE) prepares memory
 * 2. CA registers it to TEE scope.
 * 3. A handle is returned. CA can use it to communicate with TEE.
 * 4. If shared memory is not used, CA unregisters it.
 * 5. CA frees memory.
 *
 * Because it is zero-copy shared memory, the memory characteritics is inherited.
 * If the shared memory will be used for HW, CA must allocate physical continuous memory.
 *
 * Note: Because shared memory can be seen by both Normal and Secure world.
 * It is a possible weakpoint to bed attacked or leak secure data.

/* Release secure chunk memory for normal world usage.
 *
 * For better utilization, part of secure chunk memory (pre-defined size) can be used by
 * normal world through memory TA.
 * After release, pre-defined secure memory can be read/write by normal world through memroy TA, 
 * and can not be used by secure world. After append, it can be used for secure world again.
 * For easy usage at user level, a block device can be registered, and it can access released
 * secure chunk memory by memory TA.
 *  
 * How to use secure chunk memory at user level:
 * 1) Create a block device node, ex: /dev/tzmem
 * 2) Release secure chunk memory by UREE_ReleaseSecurechunkmem.
 *    After releasing, the pre-defined chunk memory will be used by normal world only.
 * 3) Open /dev/tzmem for read/write
 * 4) If finishing to use, close it.
 * 5) Append secure chunk memory back to secure world usage by UREE_AppendSecurechunkmem.
 *    After appending, the pre-defined chunk memory will not be used by normal world.
 *
 * Or simply, using APIs
 * 1) UREE_ReleaseTzmem for release secure chunk memory to normal world usage.
 * 2) UREE_AppendTzmem for append secure chunk memory back to secure world.
