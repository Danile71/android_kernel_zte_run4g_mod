this folder include 2 things
1. the folder test_case_for server is json files which can be dragged into the funambol server.
some test cases may be return 405 error code, it is ok. because some code is unsupported.

2. the tree.xml this tree include the new ims and xdm nodes.
some thing you need know: a node will not inherit it's parents access authority.
so each node must write access authority tag in the tree.xml
like:
<get/><replace/>
if only get, the node is read only. Even it has a handler.
if a node has replace, handler will be invoked, in handler can throw exception to disable write node.

the Vsend test app, which is used to trigger DM session in phone side, is in MediatekDM's folder.

the tree.xml need replace the original tree.xml when this ims feature check into common code base.
but, this file's server address is our funambol's address, if want to use CMCC's server, change it.
when use funambol server, close sms reg option and open direct wifi option in OPtions.java.
    public static final boolean USE_DIRECT_INTERNET = true;
    public static final boolean USE_SMS_REGISTER = false;
after this we can use wifi to test DM function.
