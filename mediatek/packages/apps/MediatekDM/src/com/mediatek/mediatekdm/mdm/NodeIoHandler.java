     * MDMException with MDMException.MDMError.TREE_EXT_NOT_PARTIAL. If the data is not written in a single call, it will
     * always be written in a series of calls with increasing offsets starting with an offset of 0. If offset + data.length
     * equals totalSize, then all the data has been sent and the data should now be stored if it has not been stored
     * incrementally. Before attempting partial writes, this method is called with offset and data.length both set to 0 and
     * totalSize set to the maximum length of the data. This is the only time data.length of 0 is supplied, unless totalSize
     * is also 0. Note: In certain circumstances, totalSize supplied with the last chunk of data may be a few bytes shorter
     * than that supplied with the preceding chunks. This is due to the way the SyncML protocol handles Base64 encoded data.
     * If the write fails part way through while using the partial write mechanism, then MDM will normally try to set the
     * length of the data to 0, but it is possible that the data will simply be left unfinished. If this is a problem, then
     * partial writes should be rejected and MdmException with MdmException.MdmError.TREE_EXT_NOT_PARTIAL should be thrown.
     * If it is not possible to write the value for some reason (for instance, it is in use by another program) then
     * MdmException with MdmException.MdmError.TREE_EXT_NOT_ALLOWED should be thrown.
