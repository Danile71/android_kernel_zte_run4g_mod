 * incrementally append downloaded chunks of a package, and to remove the package from non volatile storage when it is no
 * longer required. In a typical file system,the downloaded package will be stored in a file. The MDM framework requires that
 * the download package is uniquely identified by a string. Since the framework may have to access the downloaded package
 * after restarting, the download package handle cannot be a pointer, but must be a string.
